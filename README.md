# debouncing for search bar

- lets use cache to store the search results
- time complexicity

  - to search in array = O(n)
  - to search in obj = O(1)

  ["i","ip","iph","iphone"]

  {
  i:
  ip:
  iph:
  iphone:
  }

- we can also use map() (new map()) which is more optimised

- the search bar in the youtube header is using debouncing , live suggestion api , caching
